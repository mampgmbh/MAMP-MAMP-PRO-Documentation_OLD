## How to install Drupal

Download Drupal [here](https://drupal.org){:target="_blank"} . After downloading the resulting zip file should be in your `~/Downloads` folder. Unzip this drupal.zip file. You should now see a `~/Downloads/Drupal` folder. Move the contents of this folder  to `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs`.

Click on Open Start Page, then on the phpMyAdmin link. Create a database in phpMyAdmin and call it "drupal".
