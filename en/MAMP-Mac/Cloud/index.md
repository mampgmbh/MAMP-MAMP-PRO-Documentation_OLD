## Cloud

With MAMP Cloud functions your localhost can be saved to and loaded from the cloud. MAMP will save both your localhost document root folder and database data in your Dropbox. It is not necessary to install Dropbox software to use this feature, you only need a login to your Dropbox account through the MAMP interface. Additionally, you will need a Mac user account that is part of the Admin Group to install Cloud Functions. Go to Preferences > Users & Groups to confirm this.
