### Before transferring data to the cloud : Always encrypt the data
  
  Use this feature to encrypt your data before moving it to Dropbox. You can encrypt all data before transferring it to the cloud, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and an encryption key you provide. The key will be stored in the systems keychain. You cannot set the encryption key if there is cloud activity.
  
  <div class="alert" role="alert">
  When you set encryption your files will be stored on Dropbox with a .encryptedzip extension. Previously stored hosts will keep their .zip, unencrypted extension, until the are reloaded to the cloud.
