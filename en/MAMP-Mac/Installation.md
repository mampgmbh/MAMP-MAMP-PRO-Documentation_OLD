## Installation

### 1.1 Installation Requirements

To use the MAMP, your system must meet the following requirements:

Operating system: Apple OS X 10.6.6 or later
Mac with 64-Bit CPU from Intel (x84)
User account that allows to administer the computer (Administrator)

### 1.2 Installing and upgrading

Download MAMP from https://www.mamp.info.
Double click on the file MAMP_MAMP_PRO_3.0.pkg in your Downloads folder.
The System Installer will guide you through the installation process.
If the installer detects a previous MAMP installation it will rename  its MAMP folder to MAMP_current_date.
Your existing "htdocs" folder will be moved to your new `/Applications/MAMP` folder.
Make sure that all data has been transferred correctly before starting MAMP.
Your `/Applications/MAMP_current_date` folder can now be deleted. You may however keep it, so you can fall back to your original setup.
Note: You need administrator permissions to install MAMP!
When installing MAMP, an `/Applications/MAMP` Pro folder will be installed in addition to your `/Applications/MAMP` folder. You can ignore this folder if you choose not use MAMP PRO.

### 1.3 Uninstall

To uninstall MAMP, you only have to delete the MAMP directory and everything returns to the original state (MAMP does not alter anything on the normal Mac OS X).

If you have used MAMP Pro as well, use the MAMP Pro uninstaller in the `/Applications/MAMP Pro` folder to remove it.
