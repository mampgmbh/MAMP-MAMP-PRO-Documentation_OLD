## First Steps

After successful installation you can launch your local servers. Start MAMP and click on the Start Servers button. In the status display in the upper right corner, the launch status of the servers is displayed. If necessary, you will be asked for your administrator password.

The web server (Apache) starts by default on port 8888, the database server (MySQL) on port 8889. When calling your web page in a web browser, you must enter the Apache port at the end of the URL, e.g.: http://localhost:8888
