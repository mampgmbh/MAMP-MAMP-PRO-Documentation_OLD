### MAMP PRO is not allowing me to set sub-directories of my home(~) directory as a document root?

In most cases, changing your server launch users to "Unix Users" will make your permissions less restrictive and allow you to use a wider range of directories as your document root. To change your server launch users go to your [Settings > Ports](../../../Settings/Ports) tab and change the "Run Servers As:" option to "User".
