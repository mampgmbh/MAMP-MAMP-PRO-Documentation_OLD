### I am getting the following errors in my PHP error log, "FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) received from server"

If you are running CGI PHP and are receiving the following errors or similar, you must check the "Xdebug" check box on your PHP tab.

[error] [client ::1] FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) received from server "/Applications/MAMP/fcgi-bin/php5.6.30.fcgi"

FastCGI: comm with server "/Applications/MAMP/fcgi-bin/php7.0.15.fcgi" aborted: idle timeout (30 sec)
