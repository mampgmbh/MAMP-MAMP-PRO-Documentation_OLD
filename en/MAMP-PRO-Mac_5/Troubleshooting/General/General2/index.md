### When I type http://localhost in my browser it brings me to Google search?

You must include the port number when you type a your localhost url into the browser.

e.g. http://localhost:8888

What appears in your browser window thereafter may be shortened to localhost depending on the browser settings.

You can open up your localhost or additional hosts through the MAMP PRO interface. With your host highlighted, press the ![MAMP](/en/MAMP-PRO-Mac/First-Steps/BlackArrow.png) button button on the [Hosts > General](../../../Settings/Hosts/General#open_host) tab.
