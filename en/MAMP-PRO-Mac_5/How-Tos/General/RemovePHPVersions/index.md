### Remove PHP Versions from MAMP PRO

You may want to remove some versions of PHP that you do not need.

1. Stop your servers and quit MAMP PRO.
2. Delete your `/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.45` (to remove PHP 5.45) directory.
3. Start MAMP PRO, start your servers.

You should now (not) see your PHP version you removed.
