## What is MAMP PRO ?

MAMP PRO is a configuration application that helps you set up and run the Apache or Nginx web servers and the MySQL database server. It also takes care of the configuration of different versions of PHP. MAMP PRO also comes with a fully functional text editor. It is the big brother of the free MAMP application. Both applications need the `Applications/MAMP` folder to run.

Video documentation can be found in the [videos](Videos/) section.
