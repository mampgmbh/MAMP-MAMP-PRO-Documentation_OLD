### What data is in my /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/db/mysql folder?

This directory contains your pre upgraded mysql data. When you upgrade to MAMP PRO 4 your mysql is duplicated and named mysql56. Your old mysql will never be used, and when you confident all your hosts have been successfully upgraded to MySQL 5.6 you can delete this directory.
