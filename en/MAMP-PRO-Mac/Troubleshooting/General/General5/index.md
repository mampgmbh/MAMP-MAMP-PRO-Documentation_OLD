### I am getting the following error in my PHP error log, "FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) received from server"

If you are running CGI PHP and are receiving the following error or similar, you must check your "Xdebug" check box on your PHP tab.

[error] [client ::1] FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) received from server "/Applications/MAMP/fcgi-bin/php5.6.30.fcgi"
