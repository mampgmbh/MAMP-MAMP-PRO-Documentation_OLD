## WordPress Troubleshooting

### I try to open up my Wordpress site and the web browser says "Cannot connect to server" ?

Are you sure you are using right ports for your Wordpress site? You need to make sure your Wordpress site it using the same ports that it was setup with. It is best to use port 80 for a WordPress website.
