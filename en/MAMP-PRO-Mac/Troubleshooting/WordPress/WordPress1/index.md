### I try to open up my Wordpress site and the web browser says "Cannot connect to server" ?

Confirm you are using the correct ports for your Wordpress site. Wordpress will only function properly with the same Apache port it was originally setup on. It is best to use Apache port 80 for a WordPress website.
