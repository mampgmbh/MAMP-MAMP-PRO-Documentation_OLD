My Wordpress site does not work with Nginx.

Nginx does not use a .htaccess file. If your Wordpress site is using a .htaccess file you need to make some modifications to your nginx.conf file and MAMP PRO Nginx settings. More information on how to enable your Wordpress site to work with Nginx can be found [here](../../../How-Tos/General/SetupWPwithNginx/).
