## New MAMP PRO Installation

1.  Download MAMP PRO from https://www.mamp.info .
2. Double click on the MAMP_MAMP_PRO_4.0.pkg file in your Downloads folder.
3. The System Installer will guide you through the installation process.
   If the installer detects an existing MAMP folder it will rename the current MAMP folder to MAMP_current_date.
   An existing "htdocs" folder will be moved to your new `/Applications/MAMP folder`.
4. Confirm that all data has been transferred correctly before starting MAMP PRO.
   Your `/Applications/MAMP_current_date` folder can now be deleted. You may however keep it, so you can fall back to your original setup.
