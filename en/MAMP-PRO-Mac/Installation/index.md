## Installation

### Installation requirements

To use MAMP PRO, your system must meet the following requirements:

- A working MAMP installation (MAMP can be downloaded directly with the MAMP PRO installation package).
- Apple OS X, version 10.8.0 or later.
- A Mac with a 64-Bit-capable CPU.
- A user account that is part of the Admin Group. Go to Preferences > Users & Groups to confirm this.

### Installing and upgrading MAMP PRO

1. Download MAMP PRO from https://www.mamp.info.
2. Double click on the `MAMP_MAMP_PRO_4.0.pkg` file in your `Downloads` folder.
3. The System Installer will guide you through the installation process.
4. If the installer detects an existing `MAMP` folder it will rename the current MAMP folder to `MAMP_current_date`.
5. An existing `htdocs` folder will be moved to your new `/Applications/MAMP` folder.
6. Confirm that all data has been transferred correctly before starting MAMP PRO.
7. Your `/Applications/MAMP_current_date` folder can now be deleted. You may however keep it, so you can fall back to your original setup.
