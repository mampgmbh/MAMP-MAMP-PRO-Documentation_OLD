## 2. Installation

###2.1 Installation requirements

To use MAMP PRO, your system must meet the following requirements:

A working MAMP installation (MAMP can be downloaded directly with the MAMP PRO installation package).
Apple OS X, version 10.8.0 or later.
A Mac with a 64-Bit-capable CPU.
A user account that is part of the Admin Group. Go to Preferences > Users & Groups to confirm this.

###2.2 Installing and upgrading MAMP PRO

Download MAMP PRO from <https://www.mamp.info>.
Double click on the MAMP_MAMP_PRO_4.0.pkg file in your Downloads folder.
The System Installer will guide you through the installation process.
If the installer detects an existing MAMP folder it will rename the current MAMP folder to MAMP_current_date.
An existing "htdocs" folder will be moved to your new `/Applications/MAMP` folder.
Confirm that all data has been transferred correctly before starting MAMP PRO.
Your `/Applications/MAMP_current_date` folder can now be deleted. You may however keep it, so you can fall back to your original setup.
