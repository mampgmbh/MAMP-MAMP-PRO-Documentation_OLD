## Upgrading From MAMP To MAMP PRO

The MAMP installer package has already installed both a version of MAMP and MAMP PRO. The MAMP App is located in /Applications/MAMP. MAMP PRO is located in /Applications/MAMP PRO.

MAMP and MAMP PRO share many of the same installations of servers, tools and interpreters. MAMP PRO will take over where you left off in MAMP sort of speak. If you upgraded to MySQL 5.6 in MAMP, MAMP PRO will automatically launch with MySQL 5.6 .



## Open MAMP

Click on the MAMPPRO.app icon in /Applications/MAMP PRO folder.
