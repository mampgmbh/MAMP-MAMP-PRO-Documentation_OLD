## Settings > Hosts > SSL

To encrypt traffic from Apache to a web browser you can use SSL.

Use "Create self-signed certificate..." if you want to test SSL functionality.

If you want to secure a productive server you should get the Certificate file and the Certificate key file from a Certified Authority (CA).
