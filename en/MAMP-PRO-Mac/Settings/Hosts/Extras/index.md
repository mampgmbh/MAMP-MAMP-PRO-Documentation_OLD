Note: The availability of an Extra will be affected by your hosts PHP version, internet connection, cached Extras and available disk space. To add an Extra, press the plus button on the lower left side of the Extras panel. The plus button has a red circle around it if you have no Extras installed.

<div class="alert" role="alert">
Note: When a Content Management System is setup the host name and Apache port number are stored in its database. Going forward the Apache port in MAMP PRO cannot be changed. A change in the Apache port will result in breaking the CMS, returning only a vague error message. Content Management Systems usually provide a mechanism for changing the host and port names. If changes are made in the CMS, then they must also be made in MAMP PRO.
