### Accessing your MAMP PRO Hosts On A LAN

You can access your MAMP PRO hosts on a LAN using mobile devices or other Macs.

#### Only Local Host

If you only have a localhost, and no additional hosts, then accessing your host from a different Mac or mobile device can be done by entering the internal ip of your Mac.

Type in the local ip of Mac with your MAMP PRO installed and running to access your localhost. This can be done from a mobile device or other Mac. 

Note: You need to include the port Apache is running on. If you run Apache on the default port 80, then you do not need to type in a port number.

To find your local ip go to System Preferences > Network. You local ip address is shown under "Status".
