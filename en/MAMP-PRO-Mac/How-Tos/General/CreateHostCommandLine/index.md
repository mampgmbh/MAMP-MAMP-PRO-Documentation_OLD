### Create a host using the command line

You can create a host using the command by using the following steps

1. Quit MAMP PRO.
2. Open Terminal.app ( /Applications/Utilities ).
3. Enter the following line into the terminal and hit enter:  
   `/Applications/MAMP\ PRO/MAMP\ PRO.app/Contents/MacOS/MAMP\ PRO cmd createHost testHost /Applications/MAMP/htdocs2`
   
This will create a host with the name 'TestHost', with a document root of '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs2'. MAMP PRO will briefly open, and a host will be created. MAMP PRO will then quit. When you open MAMP PRO you will see your new host.
