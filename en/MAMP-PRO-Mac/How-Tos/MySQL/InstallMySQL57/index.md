### Upgrade MySQL to version 5.7

You cannot upgrade the MAMP PRO instance of MySQL. However you can install a separate instance of MySQL 5.7 on your Mac. You can download MySQL 5.7 Mac OS X 10.12 (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive here https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html 

Once you have successfully installed MAMP PRO you can run both instances of MySQL, or just your new MySQL 5.7. 

Where is your data located.

Only use Groupstart of Apache if you don't want your built in MySQL to run.

Make sure they run on different ports
