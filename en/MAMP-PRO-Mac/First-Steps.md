## 3. First Steps

### 3.1 Main GUI Elements

When the MAMP PRO application is launched for the first time its helper tools will be installed. You will be prompted to enter your admin password.

Click on the Servers button in the title bar to launch Apache and MySQL, the default web and database servers. In the Servers & Services sections, the launch status of the server is displayed. The web server uses port 8888 by default. This port must be specified when calling the local web page in the browser, e.g.: _<http://localhost:8888>_!

Your default host for MAMP PRO is localhost. The files for localhost are initially located in the `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs` folder. See the Hosts section for more information on what a host is and how to create additional hosts.
