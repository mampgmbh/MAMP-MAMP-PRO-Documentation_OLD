2. Double click on the `setup_MAMP_MAMP_PRO_4.xx.setup` file in your `Downloads` folder to start the installation process.
3. When upgrading MAMP PRO 4 your existing `C:\MAMP\htdocs\` folder will be preserved. Your existing `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Appsolute\MAMPPRO\db\` folder will be preserved by default(used by MAMP PRO). This folder contains your database data.

### Database Data

During the installation process you have the option of deleting your previous database data. If you do check this box, your database data will be deleted from `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Appsolute\MAMPPRO\db\`.
