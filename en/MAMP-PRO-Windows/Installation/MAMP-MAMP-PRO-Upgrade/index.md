## Upgrading From MAMP To MAMP PRO

The MAMP installer has already installed both a version of MAMP and MAMP PRO. The MAMP App is located in `C:\MAMP`. MAMP PRO is located in `C:\MAMP PRO`.

MAMP and MAMP PRO share many of the same installations of servers, tools and interpreters. MAMP PRO will take over where you left off in MAMP sort of speak.

*  **Open MAMP PRO**  

Click on the MAMPPRO.app icon in `C:\MAMP PRO`.

*  **Confirm Servers Are Running**

Press the 'Servers' button in the upper right corner to launch you servers. Your servers should lauch indicatd by 'On' under the 'Server and Services' section on the left side of the application.

Your database data is copied from your MAMP database data folder to your MAMP PRO database data location when you launch the servers in MAMP PRO for the first time. It is important to remember MAMP PRO will only copy your data once.

Your MAMP database data are located in 

`C:\MAMP\db`

Your MAMP PRO database data are located in 

`C:\Library\application data\appsolute\MAMP PRO\db`

Problems can occur if you had previously demoed MAMP PRO and launched your servers. Your data was copied over then. You will be looking at an old copy of your database data if you have now decided to upgrade to MAMP PRO.
