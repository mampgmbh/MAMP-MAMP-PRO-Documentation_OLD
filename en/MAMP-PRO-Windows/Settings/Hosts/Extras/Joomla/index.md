Joomla is a free and open-source content management system. More information about Joomla can be found [here](https://www.joomla.org){:target="_blank"}.

Joomla installations can share a single MySQL database if you provide a unique table prefix during installation. To use an existing database enter the name of the database and a unique table prefix. To create a new database use a unique database name. The table prefix must not be empty.
