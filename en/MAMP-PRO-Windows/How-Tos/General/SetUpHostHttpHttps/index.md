### Set up a host to be both http and https

You can get an identical http and https host by creating two hosts.

1. Set up a http host with the name "MyHost" using document root "MyDocumentRoot".
2. Set up a https host (SSL) with the name "MyHost" using document root "MyDocumentRoot".

You will get warning message stating you are using the same document root and name for multiple hosts. These hosts will appear in red.
