### Install Composer 

You can setup a host to use Composer in a few steps. Information on downloading Composer can be found [here]( https://getcomposer.org/download/){:target="_blank"}. Click on the  "Composer-Setup.exe" in the Windows Installer section. This should download an "Composer-Setup" file to your downloads folder. 

Click on the Composer-Setup and you will be guided through the installation. Proxy settings will not be covered in this How-To.

Point to the version of PHP you would like to install Composer for.
