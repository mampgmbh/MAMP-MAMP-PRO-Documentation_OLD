## Servers and Services > Dynamic DNS

If you would like to make your hosts accessible from the internet (Don't forget about security then!), but do not have a domain name that points to your PC, you will need a Dynamic DNS Service. 

If your network is connected to the internet via a router and it can handle Dynamic DNS Services, then you donâ€™t need to configure it with MAMP PRO. 

Otherwise you will need to register with a Dynamic DNS Service and enter the username and password into the appropriate fields. Then you will need to tell MAMP PRO when to inform the Dynamic DNS provider about a change in your Macs IP address. It may be necessary when you restart your computer or a DSL/Cable modem re/establishes a connection.

Note: To use the Dynamic DNS functions, you will need to register with one of the supported providers. This is independent of MAMP PRO and is not a service provided by appsolute GmbH.
