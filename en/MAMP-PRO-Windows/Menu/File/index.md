##  Menu > File

### Edit Template:<a name="edit_templates"></a>

MAMP PRO uses templates to create the necessary server config files. You can edit these templates from the menu item       File > Edit template. Here, you have access to options which are not accessible from the MAMP PRO user interface.

A template file is created in `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Appsolute\MAMPPRO\templates` when you make a change to one of your templates. There are separate templates for your Apache, Apache SSL, Nginx PHP, and MySQL configurations.
     
<div class="alert" role="alert">
Note: Errors in the templates of the configuration files can cause the servers not to start. You should edit these templates only if you are familiar with the exact syntax and meaning of the options.

*  **Apache (httpd.conf and httpd-ssl.conf)**

The httpd.conf file created from the template file and is located in `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Appsolute\MAMPPRO\conf\`. You can check this file to verify changes you are making in your template file are properly reflected.
